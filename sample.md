The "Days" concept in DevOpsDays is refering to the open space conference format where participants can propose topics and lead discussions. It encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among attendees, fostering a community-driven approach to learning and problem-solving in the DevOps field.


"DevOps" is an old concept, hos should we renew it?

# Open Space

- It's fun, but sometimers it's too big, it becomes a miniconference.
- Menu table-holders to show topics
- Smaller groups
- Facilitators (at least on larger groups") to keep track

# Slack or GitHub

We go for slack if we can get it for free - or we go to GitHub discussions
